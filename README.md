This repo contains an XLSX file ("caps_regional_hhsizes.xlsx") which presents the proportion of households that will be under-served with ITNs at different capping strategies during ITN mass campaigns. 
There are tabs for each country from the most recent DHS or MIS, and data are disaggregated by region.

This file was originally part of the supplemental material for Assessing whether universal coverage with insecticide-treated nets has been achieved: is the right indicator being used? at  https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-018-2505-0.  

Please contact me with any questions or to request the file be updated.
